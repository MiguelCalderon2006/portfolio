                    Dual Enrollment has been the greatest educational opportunity that I have had the privilege of taking advantage of. My school never offered any AP computer science classes so I decided to pursue the subject through dual enrollment. Taking advantage of this led to personal growth, unique opportunities, and allowed me to follow my passion.
                    <br><br>
                    Staying in dual enrollment was extremely challenging. I would get out of school at 4 then go to class at 6 for 4 hours. These days were really long and I couldn't get much free time at all. Through dual enrollment, I was able to take multiple core computer science courses. In one of the classes, I developed a C++ program with an interactive menu that gives the user the option to read a binary file containing periodic elements data, sorting them by atomic number, and then displaying them in an organized manner.
                    <br><br>
                    Dual enrollment allowed me to experience community college in person for the first time. This allowed me to network with college-level students, organized study sessions with them to keep my grades up. I sought out advice from my new friends from academics. I also got advice from my professor regarding school, computer science, and careers in general.
