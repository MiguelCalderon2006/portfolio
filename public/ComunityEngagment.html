                    In my local city of Santa Ana, everywhere you look there are small family-owned businesses beloved by our entire community. Inspired by all of the hard work and dedication that I've witnessed, I felt a strong calling to somehow find a way to help these businesses thrive and flourish. This brought me to found Altitud, which is a web development company with an emphasis on elevating small local businesses by developing modern and competitive websites at no cost. I manage all operations from client relations to the actual software development. This has been a passion project, fueled by the love I have for my community as well as my hunger and desire for hands-on experience with real-world projects.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the first businesses I had worked with was a family-owned pet service store. I was motivated to help this business because my family owns a puppy sold by them. I noticed that they didn't have a website and knew they could benefit from it greatly. I took the opportunity to make a difference and offered my services to the owner. I approached the project with the mindset of a professional software engineer and used developer principles such as agile and scrum methodologies. This involved breaking the work into smaller pieces, which helped me meet the owner's expectations. Despite facing a variety of technical challenges, the final result was extremely rewarding.
                    <br><br>
                    The website not only gave the store a strong online presence, but also significantly increased sales. The owner had called me to let me know that this was the fastest their products have ever been sold, and went on to express his high satisfaction with my services. After the website was complete, I had offered to maintain the website as well, ensuring that everything was up to date and running smoothly. This involved frequent meetings with the owner to update pictures, items, statuses, and profiles. The success and impact of my work have only motivated me to grow and expand my business, as I aim to empower and uplift the local businesses in my beloved community.
