                    It is a late summer night; I am coding a Batman-themed word guessing mini-game when my little brother who was up playing video games takes notice of the ASCII art on my screen. He was captivated that while he was playing a game, I was creating my own. That night we worked on the game together bouncing ideas off each other while I debugged the code. This is the night I realized my role as my little brother's guide and mentor in the world of programming.<br>
                    <br>
                    I started teaching him the basics of programming and organizing weekly tutoring sessions with him. As we got into harder concepts, I could see the spark fading away, using his free time on video games rather than programming. Knowing I had to rekindle his interest in programming I took an innovative approach. Rather than following a boring rigid course I decided to make things interesting, making mini games and having him try and replicate it using his own code. I also had to pre-plan tutoring sessions to make sure I communicated everything to him clearly. This approach was much more successful because it brought your ideas to life. Being a mentor in this situation required me to be flexible and creative in my teaching.<br>
                    <br>
                    Driven by the interesting aspects of programming, my younger brother followed suit, expressing a curious desire to kickstart his own programming journey by taking advantage of dual enrollment while in high school. I remain actively involved in helping him balance the workload of both high school and college classes, ensuring him the support and guidance needed to excel.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mentoring my little brother has taught me that leadership does not always imply the use of force or rigidity, but instead compassion, empathy, and patience. I am now well-equipped to apply those leadership values when tutoring my peers. These experiences have reinforced the idea that a good leader is a role model, and in order to help those around me, I must continue to better myself to become a positive influence to others.
