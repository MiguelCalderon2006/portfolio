                    Computer programming has become a skill that I have honed through countless hours and it has become a dedication and genuine love of mine. I have worked with multiple coding languages that include C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a few front-end frameworks like Tailwind and Bootstrap. Although balancing work between my academics and coding in my free time has been a challenge, it is a journey that has become immensely rewarding. I have come to the realization that striving for excellence in both roles requires discipline and sacrifices. In fact, I constructed a strict schedule that enhances the sufficient time for both areas; even at the expense of social leisures like video gaming and TV. This was a result of my commitment to mold myself into a high-performing student and aspiring developer.
                    <br><br>
                    Web Development became a self-taught venture that I had set out to pursue for myself. This is evident through my extensive research and engagement with resources that ensured a comprehensive education. I also endured personal financial management to purchase online courses due to the lack of programming courses offered at my high school. With more knowledge and practice, came the ability to finally design, build, and launch my own personal projects. These started out as small interactive mini games that I would craft in order to implement the new concepts I was learning. As my ambitions increased, my development with complex projects did as well. That is when I began to develop bigger and more challenging projects, such as launching my personal portfolio website in order to display all of my smaller projects.
                    <br><br>
                    This experience laid the ground for founding my web development company, Altitud. I am beyond happy to have witnessed my progression from my small games to the creation of impactful, real-world projects used by real businesses. My programming ambitions, although demanding of many sleepless nights, have been a testament to my determination to push my limits. Software development isn't just a skill for me, it's a lifelong passion that I am committed to pursuing with every line of code that I write.
